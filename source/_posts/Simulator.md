# Simulator

Experiment Report to ICS LabS.

<!--more-->

## Tasks

1. learn how to use Cmake.
2. read the code, understand the framework of the program, and train the ability to read the program.
3. replace all TO BE DONE in the code with the correct code.

## Process

I tried use only vim to edit the code, but when the file is too long , efficiency went down. So I use CLion in Windows to edit the code, then use Ubuntu run the programme. 

I read the codes line by line, and complete all TO BE DONE one by one. Because the code is very clear and understandable, there were not many problems in this stage. But most time used in debugging.üòÇ

## Debugging

I will write almost all bugs I met as follows.

1. Sign extends function used to be written incorrectly. It should simulate what the machine do.
2. I forgot all `break` in switch. What a stupid error!

## Gains

1. Through this lab, I learned how to process command parameters, and how to set debug mode by TA's marvellous codes.üëç 
2. After finishing the assembler, I understand machine language more deeply, and have known how it executives. 
3. Actually, I haven't use command to compile and run a single C++ programme. Thanks to lab A and lab S, I learned to do so. 
4. No pains, no gains!
