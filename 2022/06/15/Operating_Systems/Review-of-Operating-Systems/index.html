<span id="more"></span>
<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<h2 id="computer-system-overview">Computer System Overview</h2>
<p>1.1. List and briefly define the four main elements of a computer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Processor : Controls the operation of the computer and performs its data processing functions.</li>
<li>Main memory : Stores data and programs.</li>
<li>I/O modules: Move data between the computer and its external environment.</li>
<li>System bus : Provides for communication among processors, main memory, and I/O modules.</li>
</ul>
<p>1.2. Define the two main categories of processor registers.</p>
<ul>
<li>A memory address register (MAR), which specifies the address in memory for the next read or write;</li>
<li>A memory buffer register (MBR), which contains the data to be written into memory, or receives the data read from memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>1.3. In general terms, what are the four distinct actions that a machine instruction can specify?</p>
<ul>
<li>Processor-memory: Data may be transferred from processor to memory, or from memory to processor.</li>
<li>Processor-I/O: Data may be transferred to or from a peripheral device by transferring between the processor and an I/O module.</li>
<li>Data processing: The processor may perform some arithmetic or logic operation on data.</li>
<li>Control: An instruction may specify that the sequence of execution be altered.</li>
</ul>
<p>1.4. What is an interrupt?</p>
<p>An interrupt is a signal which is sent from a device or from software to the operating system.</p>
<p>1.5. How are multiple interrupts dealt with?</p>
<ul>
<li>The first is to disable interrupts while an interrupt is being processed.</li>
<li>A second approach is to define priorities for interrupts and to allow an interrupt of higher priority to cause a lower-priority interrupt handler to be interrupted.</li>

<p>1.10. In general, what are the strategies for exploiting spatial locality and temporal locality?</p>
<p>Spatial locality is exploited using larger cache blocks and prefetching.</p>
<p>Temporal locality is exploited by keeping recently used instructions and data values in the cache memory, and by exploiting cache hierarchy.</p>
<h2 id="operation-system-overview">Operation System Overview</h2>
<p>2.1. What are three objectives of an OS design?</p>
<ul>
<li>Convenience: An OS makes a computer more convenient to use.</li>
<li>Efficiency: An OS allows the computer system resources to be used in an efficient manner.</li>
<li>Ability to evolve: An OS should be constructed in such a way as to permit the effective development, testing, and introduction of new system functions without interfering with service.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.2. What is the kernel of an OS?</p>
<p>A portion of the operating system that includes the most heavily used portions of software. Generally, the kernel is maintained permanently in main memory. The kernel runs in a privileged mode and responds to calls from processes and interrupts from devices.</p>
<p>2.3. What is multiprogramming?</p>
<p>A mode of operation that provides for the interleaved execution of two or more computer programs by a single processor. The same as multitasking, using different terminology.</p>
<p>2.4. What is a process?</p>
<p>A program in execution. A process is controlled and scheduled by the operating system. Same as task.</p>
<p>2.5. How is the execution context of a process used by the OS?</p>
<p>The execution context , or process state , is the internal data by which the OS is able to supervise and control the process. This internal information is separated from the process, because the OS has information not permitted to the process. The context includes all of the information the OS needs to manage the process, and the processor needs to execute the process properly. The context includes the contents of the various processor registers, such as the program counter and data registers. It also includes information of use to the OS, such as the priority of the process and whether the process is waiting for the completion of a particular I/O event.</p>
<p>2.6. List and briefly explain five storage management responsibilities of a typical OS.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Process isolation: The OS must prevent independent processes from interfering with each other’s memory, both data and instructions.</p></li>
<li>Automatic allocation and management: Programs should be dynamically allocated across the memory hierarchy as required. Allocation should be transparent to the programmer. Thus, the programmer is relieved of concerns relating to memory limitations, and the OS can achieve efficiency by assigning memory to jobs only as needed.</li>
<li>Support of modular programming: Programmers should be able to define program modules, and to dynamically create, destroy, and alter the size of modules.</li>
<li>Protection and access control: Sharing of memory, at any level of the memory hierarchy, creates the potential for one program to address the memory space of another. This is desirable when sharing is needed by particular applications. At other times, it threatens the integrity of programs and even of the OS itself. The OS must allow portions of memory to be accessible in various ways by various users.</li>
<li><p>Long-term storage: Many application programs require means for storing information for extended periods of time, after the computer has been powered down.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>2.7. Explain the distinction between a real address and a virtual address.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>real address: A physical address in main memory.</p></li>
<li><p>virtual address: The address of a storage location in virtual memory.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>2.8. Describe the round-robin scheduling technique.</p>
<p>A scheduling algorithm in which processes are activated in a fixed cyclic order; that is, all processes are in a circular queue. A process that cannot proceed because it is waiting for some event (e.g., termination of a child process or an input/output operation) returns control to the scheduler.</p>
<p>2.9. Explain the difference between a monolithic kernel and a microkernel.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>monolithic kernel: A large kernel containing virtually the complete operating system, including scheduling, file system, device drivers, and memory management. All the functional components of the kernel have access to all of its internal data structures and routines. Typically, a monolithic kernel is implemented as a single process, with all elements sharing the same address space.</p></li>
<li><p>microkernel: A small, privileged operating system core that provides process scheduling, memory management, and communication services and relies on other processes to perform some of the functions traditionally associated with the operating system kernel.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>2.10. What is multithreading?</p>
<p>Multitasking within a single program. It allows multiple streams of instructions (threads) to execute concurrently within the same program, each stream processing a different transaction or message. Each stream is a “subprocess,” and the operating system typically cooperates with the application to handle the threads.</p>
<p>2.11. List the key design issues for an SMP operating system.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simultanetous concurrent processes or threads: Kernel routines need to be reentrant to allow several processors toexecute the same kernel code simultaneously. With multiple processors executing the same or different parts of the kernel, kernel tables and management structures must be managed properly to avoid data corruption or invalid operations.</li>
<li>Scheduling: Any processor may perform scheduling, which complicates the task of enforcing a scheduling policy and assuring that corruption of the scheduler data structures is avoided. If kernel-level multithreading is used, then the opportunity exists to schedule multiple threads from the same process simultaneously on multiple processors.</li>
<li>Synchronization: With multiple active processes having potential access to shared address spaces or shared I/O resources, care must be taken to provide effective synchronization. Synchronization is a facility that enforces mutual exclusion and event ordering. A common synchronization mechanism used in multiprocessor operating systems is locks.</li>
<li>Memory management: Memory management on a multiprocessor must deal with all of the issues found on uniprocessor computers, and will be discussed in Part Three. In addition, the OS needs to exploit the available hardware parallelism to achieve the best performance. The paging mechanisms on different processors must be coordinated to enforce consistency when several processors share a page or segment and to decide on page replacement. The reuse of physical pages is the biggest problem of concern; that is, it mustbe guaranteed that a physical page can no longer be accessed with its old contents before the page is put to a new use.</li>
<li>Reliability and fault tolerance: The OS should provide graceful degradation in the face of processor failure. The scheduler and other portions of the OS must recognize the loss of a processor and restructure management tables accordingly.</li>

<p>3.3. For the processing model of Figure 3.6 , briefly define each state.</p>
<p><img src="https://gsxgoldenlegendary.github.io/images/Operating_Systems/osidp3-3-0.png" /></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Running: The process that is currently being executed. For this chapter, we will assume a computer with a single processor, so at most, one process at a time can be in this state.</li>
<li>Ready: A process that is prepared to execute when given the opportunity.</li>
<li>Blocked/Waiting: A process that cannot execute until some event occurs, such as the completion of an I/O operation.</li>
<li>New: A process that has just been created but has not yet been admitted to the pool of executable processes by the OS. Typically, a new process has not yet been loaded into main memory, although its process control block has been created.</li>
<li>Exit: A process that has been released from the pool of executable processes by the OS, either because it halted or because it aborted for some reason.</li>
</ol>
<p>3.4. What does it mean to preempt a process?</p>
<p>Reclaiming a resource from a process before the process has finished using it.</p>
<p>3.5. What is swapping and what is its purpose?</p>
<p>A process that interchanges the contents of an area of main storage with the contents of an area in secondary memory.</p>
<p>Solve the ploblem that is I/O activities are much slower than computation, and therefore the processor in a uniprogramming system is idle most of the time.</p>
<p>3.6. Why does Figure 3.9b have two blocked states?</p>
<p><img src="https://gsxgoldenlegendary.github.io/images/Operating_Systems/osidp3-6-0.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Blocked → Blocked/Suspend :If there are no ready processes, then at least one blocked process is swapped out to make room for another process that is not blocked. This transition can be made even if there are ready processes available. In particular, if the OS determines that the currently running process, or a ready process that it would like to dispatch, requires more main memory to maintain adequate performance, a blocked process will be suspended.</p></li>
<li><p>Blocked/Suspend → Blocked : Inclusion of this transition may seem to be poor design. After all, if a process is not ready to execute and is not already in main memory, what is the point of bringing it in? But consider the following scenario: A process terminates, freeing up some main memory. There is a process in the (Blocked/Suspend) queue with a higher priority than any of the processes in the (Ready/Suspend) queue and the OS has reason to believe that the blocking event for that process will occur soon. Under these circumstances, it would seemreasonable to bring a blocked process into main memory in preference to a ready process.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>3.7. List four characteristics of a suspended process.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The process is not immediately available for execution.</li>
<li>The process may or may not be waiting on an event. If it is, this blocked condition is independent of the suspend condition, and occurrence of the blocking event does not enable the process to be executed immediately.</li>
<li>The process was placed in a suspended state by an agent: either itself, a parent process, or the OS, for the purpose of preventing its execution.</li>
<li>The process may not be removed from this state until the agent explicitly orders the removal.</li>
</ol>
<p>3.8. For what types of entities does the OS maintain tables of information for management purposes?</p>
<p>Memory, I/O, file, and process.</p>
<p>3.9. List three general categories of information in a process control block.</p>
<p>Process identification, processor state information, and process control information.</p>
<p>3.10. Why are two modes (user and kernel) needed?</p>
<p>It is necessary to protect the OS and key operating system tables, such as process control blocks, from interference by user programs.</p>
<p>3.11. What are the steps performed by an OS to create a new process?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Assign a unique process identifier to the new process. At this time, a new entry is added to the primary process table, which contains one entry per process.</li>
<li>Allocate space for the process. This includes all elements of the process image. Thus, the OS must know how much space is needed for the private user address space (programs and data) and the user stack. These values can be assigned by default based on the type of process, or they can be set based on user request at job creation time. If a process is spawned by another process, the parent process can pass the needed values to the OS as part of the process creation request. If any existing address space is to be shared by this new process, the appropriate linkages must be set up. Finally, space for a process control block must be allocated.</li>
<li>Initialize the process control block. The process identification portion contains the ID of this process plus other appropriate IDs, such as that of the parent process. Theprocessor state information portion will typically be initialized with most entries zero, except for the program counter (set to the program entry point) and system stack pointers (set to define the process stack boundaries). The process control information portion is initialized based on standard default values plus attributes that have been requested for this process. For example, the process state would typically be initialized to Ready or Ready/Suspend. The priority may be set by default to the lowest priority unless an explicit request is made for a higher priority. Initially, the process may own no resources (I/O devices, files) unless there is an explicit request for these, or unless they are inherited from the parent.</li>
<li>Set the appropriate linkages. For example, if the OS maintains each scheduling queue as a linked list, then the new process must be put in the Ready or Ready/Suspend list.</li>
<li>Create or expand other data structures. For example, the OS may maintain an accounting file on each process to be used subsequently for billing and/or performance assessment purposes.</li>
</ol>
<p>3.12. What is the difference between an interrupt and a trap?</p>
<p>interrupt: A suspension of a process, such as the execution of a computer program, caused by an event external to that process and performed in such a way that the process can be resumed.</p>
<p>trap: An unprogrammed conditional jump to a specified address that is automatically activated by hardware; the location from which the jump was made is recorded.</p>

</table>
<p>3.13. Give three examples of an interrupt.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clock interrupt: The OS determines whether the currently running process has been executing for the maximum allowable unit of time, referred to as a time slice . That is, a time slice is the maximum amount of time that a process can execute before being interrupted. If so, this process must be switched to a Ready state and another process dispatched.</li>
<li>I/O interrupt: The OS determines what I/O action has occurred. If the I/O action constitutes an event for which one or more processes are waiting, then the OS moves all of the corresponding blocked processes to the Ready state (and Blocked/Suspend processes to the Ready/Suspend state). The OS must then decide whether to resume execution of the process currently in the Running state, or to preempt that process for a higher-priority Ready process.</li>
<li>Memory fault: The processor encounters a virtual memory address reference for a word that is not in main memory. The OS must bring in the block (page or segment) of memory containing the reference from secondary memory to main memory. After the I/O request is issued to bring in the block of memory, the process with the memory fault is placed in a blocked state; the OS then performs a process switch to resume execution of another process. After the desired block is brought into memory, that process is placed in the Ready state.</li>
</ul>
<p>3.14. What is the difference between a mode switch and a process switch?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>mode switch: A hardware operation that occurs that causes the processor to execute in a different mode (kernel or process). When the mode switches from process to kernel, the program counter, processor status word, and other registers are saved. When the mode switches from kernel to process, this information is restored.</p></li>
<li><p>process switch: An operation that switches the processor from one process to another by saving all the process control block, registers, and other information for the first and replacing them with the process information for the second.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="threads">Threads</h2>

<ul>
<li>Thread control block handle Scheduling and State Information.</li>
<li>Data Structuring also be handled by thread control block (mostly, except block and terminal) .</li>
<li>Privileges and Interprocess Communications can probably be divided between the two blocks depending on the system.</li>
<li>Memory Management and Resource Ownership and Utilization should belong to process control block.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>4.2. List reasons why a mode switch between threads may be cheaper than a mode switch between processes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Less state information is involved.</li>
<li>Usually doesn't require a big change in Virtual Memory.</li>
<li>Usually doesn't need the caches to be flushed.</li>
</ul>
<p>4.3. What are the two separate and potentially independent characteristics embodied in the concept of process?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Resource ownership: A process includes a virtual address space to hold the process image; recall from Chapter 3 that the process image is the collection of program, data, stack, and attributes defined in the process control block. From time to time, a process may be allocated control or ownership of resources, such as main memory, I/O channels, I/O devices, and files. The OS performs a protection function to prevent unwanted interference between processes with respect to resources.</li>
<li>Scheduling/execution: The execution of a process follows an execution path (trace) through one or more programs (e.g., Figure 1.5 ). This execution may be interleaved with that of other processes. Thus, a process has an execution state (Running, Ready, etc.) and a dispatching priority, and is the entity that is scheduled and dispatched by the OS.</li>
</ol>
<p>4.4. Give four general examples of the use of threads in a single-user multiprocessing system.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Foreground and background work: For example, in a spreadsheet program, one thread could display menus and read user input, while another thread executes user commands and updates the spreadsheet. This arrangement often increases the perceived speed of the application by allowing the program to prompt for the next command before the previous command is complete.</li>
<li>Asynchronous processing: Asynchronous elements in the program can be implemented as threads. For example, as a protection against power failure, one can design a word processor to write its random access memory (RAM) buffer to disk once every minute. A thread can be created whose sole job is periodic backup and that schedules itself directly with the OS; there is no need for fancy code in the main program to provide for time checks or to coordinate input and output.</li>
<li>Speed of execution: A multithreaded process can compute one batch of data while reading the next batch from a device. On a multiprocessor system, multiple threads from the same process may be able to execute simultaneously. Thus, even though one thread may be blocked for an I/O operation to read in a batch of data, another thread may be executing.</li>
<li>Modular program structure: Programs that involve a variety of activities or a variety of sources and destinations of input and output may be easier to design and implement using threads.</li>
</ol>
<p>4.5. What resources are typically shared by all of the threads of a process?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Main memory</li>
<li>Input Output Devices</li>
<li>Input Output Channels</li>
<li>Files</li>
</ol>
<p>4.6. List three advantages of ULTs over KLTs.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Thread switching does not require kernel-mode privileges because all of the thread management data structures are within the user address space of a single process. Therefore, the process does not switch to the kernel mode to do thread management. This saves the overhead of two mode switches (user to kernel; kernel back to user).</li>
<li>Scheduling can be application specific. One application may benefit most from a simple round-robin scheduling algorithm, while another might benefit from a priority-based scheduling algorithm. The scheduling algorithm can be tailored to the application without disturbing the underlying OS scheduler.</li>
<li>ULTs can run on any OS. No changes are required to the underlying kernel to support ULTs. The threads library is a set of application-level functions shared by all applications.</li>
</ol>
<p>4.7. List two disadvantages of ULTs compared to KLTs.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In a typical OS, many system calls are blocking. As a result, when a ULT executes a system call, not only is that thread blocked, but all of the threads within the process are blocked as well.</li>
<li>In a pure ULT strategy, a multithreaded application cannot take advantage of multiprocessing. A kernel assigns one process to only one processor at a time. Therefore, only a single thread within a process can execute at a time. In effect,we have application-level multiprogramming within a single process. While this multiprogramming can result in a significant speedup of the application, there are applications that would benefit from the ability to execute portions of code simultaneously.</li>
</ol>
<p>4.8. Define jacketing.</p>
<p>The purpose of jacketing is to convert a blocking system call into a nonblocking system call.</p>
<h2 id="concurrency-mutual-exclusion-and-synchronization">Concurrency: Mutual Exclusion and Synchronization</h2>
<p>5.1. List four design issues for which the concept of concurrency is relevant.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Communication among processes.</li>
<li>Sharing of and competing for resources (such as memory, files, and I/O access).</li>
<li>Synchronization of the activities of multiple processes.</li>
<li>Allocation of processor time to processes.</li>
</ol>
<p>5.2. What are three contexts in which concurrency arises?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Multiple applications: Multiprogramming was invented to allow processing time to be dynamically shared among a number of active applications.</p></li>
<li>Structured applications: As an extension of the principles of modular design and structured programming, some applications can be effectively programmed as a set of concurrent processes.</li>
<li><p>Operating system structure: The same structuring advantages apply to systems programs, and we have seen that operating systems are themselves often implemented as a set of processes or threads.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>5.3. What is the basic requirement for the execution of concurrent processes?</p>
<p>The ability to enforce mutual exclusion.</p>
<p>5.4. List three degrees of awareness between processes and briefly define each.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Processes unaware of each other: These are independent processes that are not intended to work together. The best example of this situation is the multiprogramming of multiple independent processes. These can either be batch jobs or interactive sessions or a mixture. Although the processes are not working together, the OS needs to be concerned about competition for resources. For example, two independent applications may both want to access the same disk or file or printer. The OS must regulate these accesses.</li>
<li>Processes indirectly aware of each other: These are processes that are not necessarily aware of each other by their respective process IDs but that share access to some object, such as an I/O buffer. Such processes exhibit cooperation in sharing the common object.</li>
<li>Processes directly aware of each other: These are processes that are able to communicate with each other by process ID and that are designed to work jointly on some activity. Again, such processes exhibit cooperation.</li>
</ol>
<p>5.5. What is the distinction between competing processes and cooperating processes?</p>
<ul>
<li>Competing processes: Compete for resources, like access to the same file or I/O device, processor time.</li>
<li>Cooperating processes: Share resources or communication. May or may not be ware of each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>5.6. List the three control problems associated with competing processes, and briefly define each.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mutual exclusion: A condition in which there is a set of processes, only one of which is able to access a given resource or perform a given function at any time. See critical section.</p></li>
<li><p>Deadlock: (1) An impasse that occurs when multiple processes are waiting for the availability of a resource that will not become available because it is being held by another process that is in a similar wait state. (2) An impasse that occurs when multiple processes are waiting for an action by or a response from another process that is in a similar wait state.</p></li>
<li><p>Starvation: A condition in which a process is indefinitely delayed because other processes are always given preference.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>5.7. List the requirements for mutual exclusion.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Mutual exclusion must be enforced: Only one process at a time is allowed into its critical section, among all processes that have critical sections for the same resource or shared object.</li>
<li>A process that halts in its noncritical section must do so without interfering with other processes.</li>
<li>It must not be possible for a process requiring access to a critical section to be delayed indefinitely: no deadlock or starvation.</li>
<li>When no process is in a critical section, any process that requests entry to its critical section must be permitted to enter without delay.</li>
<li>No assumptions are made about relative process speeds or number of processors.</li>
<li>A process remains inside its critical section for a finite time only.</li>
</ol>
<p>5.8. What operations can be performed on a semaphore?</p>
<p>Initialize, decrement, and increment.</p>
<p>5.9. What is the difference between binary and general semaphores?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Binary semaphore: A semaphore that takes on only the values 0 and 1. A binary semaphore allows only one process or thread to have access to a shared critical resource at a time.</p></li>
<li><p>General semaphore: An integer value used for signaling among processes. Only three operations may be performed on a semaphore, all of which are atomic: initialize, decrement, and increment. Depending on the exact definition of the semaphore, the decrement operation may result in the blocking of a process, and the increment operation may result in the unblocking of a process.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>5.10. What is the difference between strong and weak semaphores?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Strong semaphore: A semaphore in which all processes waiting on the same semaphore are queued and will eventually proceed in the same order as they executed the wait (P) operations (FIFO order).</p></li>
<li><p>Weak semaphore: A semaphore in which all processes waiting on the same semaphore proceed in an unspecified order (i.e., the order is unknown or indeterminate).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>5.11. What is a monitor?</p>
<p>A programming language construct that encapsulates variables, access procedures, and initialization code within an abstract data type. The monitor’s variable may only be accessed via its access procedures and only one process may be actively accessing the monitor at any one time. The access procedures are critical sections. A monitor may have a queue of processes that are waiting to access it.</p>
<p>5.12. What is the distinction between blocking and nonblocking with respect to messages?</p>
<ul>
<li>Blocking send, blocking receive: Both the sender and receiver are blocked until the message is delivered; this is sometimes referred to as a rendezvous. This combination allows for tight synchronization between processes.</li>
<li>Nonblocking send, blocking receive: Although the sender may continue on, the receiver is blocked until the requested message arrives. This is probably the most useful combination. It allows a process to send one or more messages to a variety of destinations as quickly as possible. A process that must receive a message before it can do useful work needs to be blocked until such a message arrives. An example is a server process that exists to provide a service or resource to other processes.</li>
<li>Nonblocking send, nonblocking receive: Neither party is required to wait.</li>
</ul>
<p>5.13. What conditions are generally associated with the readers/writers problem?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Any number of readers may simultaneously read the file.</li>
<li>Only one writer at a time may write to the file.</li>
<li>If a writer is writing to the file, no reader may read it.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="concurrency-deadlock-and-starvation">Concurrency: Deadlock and Starvation</h2>
<p>6.1. Give examples of reusable and consumable resources.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Examples of reusable resources include processors, I/O channels, main and secondary memory, devices, and data structures (such as files, databases, and semaphores).</p></li>
<li><p>Examples of consumable resources are interrupts, signals, messages, and information in I/O buffers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>6.2. What are the three conditions that must be present for deadlock to be possible?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Mutual exclusion. Only one process may use a resource at a time. No process may access a resource unit that has been allocated to another process.</li>
<li>Hold and wait. A process may hold allocated resources while awaiting assignment of other resources.</li>
<li>No preemption. No resource can be forcibly removed from a process holding it.</li>
</ol>
<p>6.3. What are the four conditions that create deadlock?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Mutual exclusion. Only one process may use a resource at a time. No process may access a resource unit that has been allocated to another process.</li>
<li>Hold and wait. A process may hold allocated resources while awaiting assignment of other resources.</li>
<li><p>No preemption. No resource can be forcibly removed from a process holding it.</p></li>
<li><p>Circular wait. A closed chain of processes exists, such that each process holds at least one resource needed by the next process in the chain .</p></li>
</ol>
<p>6.4. How can the hold-and-wait condition be prevented?</p>
<p>The hold-and-wait condition can be prevented by requiring that a process request all of its required resources at one time and blocking the process until all requests can be granted simultaneously.</p>
<p>6.5. List two ways in which the no-preemption condition can be prevented.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, if a process holding certain resources is denied a further request, that process must release its original resources and, if necessary, request them again together with the additional resource.</li>
<li>Alternatively, if a process requests a resource that is currently held by another process, the OS may preempt the second process and require it to release its resources.</li>
<li>This latter scheme would prevent deadlock only if no two processes possessed the same priority.</li>
</ul>
<p>6.6. How can the circular wait condition be prevented?</p>
<p>The circular wait condition can be prevented by defining a linear ordering of resource types.</p>
<p>6.7. What is the difference among deadlock avoidance, detection, and prevention?</p>
<ul>
<li>Deadlock avoidance: A dynamic technique that examines each new resource request for deadlock. If the new request could lead to a deadlock, then the request is denied.</li>
<li>Deadlock detection: A technique in which requested resources are always granted when available. Periodically, the operating system tests for deadlock.</li>
<li>Deadlock prevention: A technique that guarantees that a deadlock will not occur. Prevention is achieved by assuring that one of the necessary conditions for deadlock is not met.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="memory">Memory</h1>
<h2 id="memory-management">Memory Management</h2>
<p>7.1. What requirements is memory management intended to satisfy?</p>
<p>Relocation, Protection, Sharing, Logical organization, and Physical organization.</p>
<p>7.2. Why is the capability to relocate processes desirable?</p>
<p>Typically, it is not possible for the programmer to know in advance which other programs will be resident in main memory at the time of execution of the program. In addition, we would like to be able to swap active processes in and out of main memory to maximize processor utilization by providing a large pool of ready processes to execute.</p>
<p>7.3. Why is it not possible to enforce memory protection at compile time?</p>
<p>Because the location of a program in main memory is unpredictable.</p>
<p>7.4. What are some reasons to allow two or more processes to all have access to a particular region of memory?</p>
<ul>
<li>It is advantageous to allow each process to access the same copy of the program, rather than have its own separate copy.</li>
<li>Processes that are cooperating on some task may need to share access to the same data structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>7.5. In a fixed partitioning scheme, what are the advantages of using unequal-size partitions?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The number of partitions specified at system generation time limits the number of active (not suspended) processes in the system.</li>
<li>Because partition sizes are preset at system generation time, small jobs will not utilize partition space efficiently. In an environment where the main storage requirement of all jobs is known beforehand, this may be reasonable, but in most cases, it is an inefficient technique.</li>
</ol>
<p>7.6. What is the difference between internal and external fragmentation?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Internal fragmentation: Occurs when memory is divided into fixed-size partitions (e.g., page frames in main memory, physical blocks on disk). If a block of data is assigned to one or more partitions, then there may be wasted space in the last partition. This will occur if the last portion of data is smaller than the last partition.</p></li>
<li><p>External fragmentation: Occurs when memory is divided into variable-size partitions corresponding to the blocks of data assigned to the memory (e.g., segments in main memory). As segments are moved into and out of the memory, gaps will occur between the occupied portions of memory.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>7.7. What are the distinctions among logical, relative, and physical addresses?</p>
<ul>
<li>Logical address: A reference to a memory location independent of the current assignment of data to memory. A translation must be made to a physical address before the memory access can be achieved.</li>
<li>Relative address: An address calculated as a displacement from a base address.</li>
<li>Physical address: The absolute location of a unit of data in memory (e.g., word or byte in main memory, block on secondary memory).</li>
</ul>
<p>7.8. What is the difference between a page and a frame?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Page: In virtual storage, a fixed-length block that has a virtual address and is transferred as a unit between main memory and secondary memory.</p></li>
<li><p>Frame: In paged virtual storage, a fixed-length block of main memory that is used to hold one page of virtual memory.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>7.9. What is the difference between a page and a segment?</p>
<ul>
<li>Page: In virtual storage, a fixed-length block that has a virtual address and is transferred as a unit between main memory and secondary memory.</li>
<li>Segment: In virtual memory, a block that has a virtual address. The blocks of a program may be of unequal length, and may even be of dynamically varying lengths.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="virtual-memory">Virtual Memory</h2>
<p>8.1. What is the difference between simple paging and virtual memory paging?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Simple paging: All the pages of a process must be in main memory for process to run, unless overlays are used.</p></li>
<li><p>Virtual memory paging: Not all pages of a process need be in main memory frames for the process to run; pages may be read in as needed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>8.2. Explain thrashing.</p>
<p>A phenomenon in virtual memory schemes, in which the processor spends most of its time swapping pieces rather than executing instructions.</p>
<p>8.3. Why is the principle of locality crucial to the use of virtual memory?</p>
<p>To summarize, the principle of locality states that program and data references within a process tend to cluster. Hence, the assumption that only a few pieces of a process will be needed over a short period of time is valid. Also, it should be possible to make intelligent guesses about which pieces of a process will be needed in the near future, which avoids thrashing.</p>
<p>8.4. What elements are typically found in a page table entry? Briefly define each element.</p>
<ul>
<li>The frame number, which tells the corresponding page in main memory.</li>
<li>A modify (M) bit, which indicates whether the contents of the corresponding page have been altered since the page was last loaded into main memory.</li>
<li>A present (P) bit, which indicates whether the corresponding page is in main memory or not.</li>
</ul>
<p>8.5. What is the purpose of a translation lookaside buffer?</p>
<p>To reduce the memory access time of a virtual memory scheme. It acts as a cache for page table entries that have been most recently used.</p>
<p>8.6. Briefly define the alternative page fetch policies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Demand paging: The transfer of a page from secondary memory to main memory storage at the moment of need.</li>
<li>Prepaging: The retrieval of pages other than the one demanded by a page fault. The hope is that the additional pages will be needed in the near future, conserving disk I/O. Compare demand paging.</li>
</ul>
<p>8.7. What is the difference between resident set management and page replacement policy?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Resident set management: How many page frames are to be allocated to each active process, and whether the set of pages to be considered for replacement should be limited to those of the process that caused the page fault or encompass all the page frames in main memory.</p></li>
<li><p>Replacement policy: Among the set of pages considered, which particular page should be selected for replacement.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>8.8. What is the relationship between FIFO and clock page replacement algorithms?</p>
<p>Both treat the page frames allocated to a process as a circular buffer, with which a pointer is associated.</p>
<p>8.9. What is accomplished by page buffering?</p>
<p>Improving paging performance and allowing the use of a simpler page replacement policy.</p>
<p>8.10. Why is it not possible to combine a global replacement policy and a fixed allocation policy?</p>
<p>While it happens that local policies are easier to analyze, there is no convincing evidence that they perform better than global policies, which are attractive because of their simplicity of implementation and minimal overhead. It could be impossible to get a win-win choice.</p>
<p>8.11. What is the difference between a resident set and a working set?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Resident set: That portion of a process that is actually in main memory at a given time.</p></li>
<li><p>Working set: The working set with parameter Δ for a process at virtual time t, W(t, Δ) is the set of pages of that process that have been referenced in the last Δ time units.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>8.12. What is the difference between demand cleaning and precleaning?</p>
<ul>
<li>With demand cleaning, a page is written out to secondary memory only when it has been selected for replacement.</li>
<li>A precleaning policy writes modified pages before their page frames are needed so pages can be written out in batches.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="scheduling">Scheduling</h1>
<h2 id="uniprocessor-scheduling">Uniprocessor Scheduling</h2>
<p>9.1. Briefly describe the three types of processor scheduling.</p>
<ul>
<li>Long-term scheduling: The decision to add to the pool of processes to be executed.</li>
<li>Medium-term scheduling: The decision to add to the number of processes that are partially or fully in main memory.</li>
<li>Short-term scheduling: The decision as to which available process will be executed by the processor.</li>
</ul>
<p>9.2. What is usually the critical performance requirement in an interactive operating system?</p>
<p>Adequate response time.</p>
<p>9.3. What is the difference between turnaround time and response time?</p>
<ul>
<li>Turnaround time: Total time in system, waiting plus execution.</li>
<li>Response time: In a data system, the elapsed time between the end of transmission of an enquiry message and the beginning of the receipt of a response message, measured at the enquiry terminal.</li>
</ul>
<p>9.4. For process scheduling, does a low-priority value represent a low priority or a high priority?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In UNIX and many other systems, larger-priority values represent lower-priority processes; unless otherwise stated we follow that convention.</p></li>
<li><p>Some systems, such as Windows, use the opposite convention: a higher number means a higher priority.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>9.5. What is the difference between preemptive and nonpreemptive scheduling?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Preemptive: The currently running process may be interrupted and moved to the Ready state by the OS. The decision to preempt may be performed when a new process arrives, when an interrupt occurs that places a blocked process in the Ready state, or periodically, based on a clock interrupt.</p></li>
<li><p>Nonpreemptive: In this case, once a process is in the Running state, it continues to execute until (a) it terminates or (b) it blocks itself to wait for I/O or to request some OS service.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>9.6. Briefly define FCFS scheduling.</p>
<p>A queueing technique in which the next item to be retrieved is the item that has been in the queue for the longest time.</p>
<p>9.7. Briefly define round-robin scheduling.</p>
<p>A clock interrupt is generated at periodic intervals. When the interrupt occurs, the currently running process is placed in the ready queue, and the next ready job is selected on a FCFS basis.</p>
<p>9.8. Briefly define shortest-process-next scheduling.</p>
<p>This is a nonpreemptive policy in which the process with the shortest expected processing time is selected next.</p>
<p>9.9. Briefly define shortest-remaining-time scheduling.</p>
<p>In this case, the scheduler always chooses the process that has the shortest expected remaining processing time. When a new process joins the ready queue, it may in fact have a shorter remaining time than the currently running process. Accordingly, the scheduler may preempt the current process when a new process becomes ready.</p>
<p>9.10. Briefly define highest-response-ratio-next scheduling.</p>
<p>When the current process completes or is blocked, choose the ready process with the greatest value of R. R=(w+s)/s, R = response ratio, w = time spent waiting for the processor, and s = expected service time.</p>
<p>9.11. Briefly define feedback scheduling.</p>
<p>The way to do this is as follows. Scheduling is done on a preemptive (at time quantum) basis, and a dynamic priority mechanism is used. When a process first enters the system, it is placed in RQ0. After its first preemption, when it returns to the Ready state, it is placed in RQ1. Each subsequent time that it is preempted, it is demoted to the next lower-priority queue. A short process will complete quickly, without migrating very far down the hierarchy of ready queues. A longer process will gradually drift downward. Thus, newer, shorter processes are favored over older, longer processes. Within each queue, except the lowest-priority queue, a simple FCFS mechanism is used. Once in the lowest-priority queue, a process cannot go lower, but is returned to this queue repeatedly until it completes execution.</p>

</table>
<p>10.2. List and briefly define four techniques for thread scheduling.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Load sharing: Processes are not assigned to a particular processor. A global queue of ready threads is maintained, and each processor, when idle, selects a thread from the queue.</li>
<li>Gang scheduling: A set of related threads is scheduled to run on a set of processors at the same time, on a one-to-one basis.</li>
<li>Dedicated processor assignment: This is the opposite of the load-sharing approach and provides implicit scheduling defined by the assignment of threads to processors. Each program, for the duration of its execution, is allocated a number of processors equal to the number of threads in the program. When the program terminates, the processors return to the general pool for possible allocation to another program.</li>
<li>Dynamic scheduling: The number of threads in a process can be altered during the course of execution.</li>
</ol>
<p>10.3. List and briefly define three versions of load sharing.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First-come-first-served (FCFS): When a job arrives, each of its threads is placed consecutively at the end of the shared queue. When a processor becomes idle, it picks the next ready thread, which it executes until completion or blocking.</li>
<li>Smallest number of threads first: The shared ready queue is organized as a priority queue, with highest priority given to threads from jobs with the smallest number of unscheduled threads. Jobs of equal priority are ordered according to which job arrives first. As with FCFS, a scheduled thread is run to completion or blocking.</li>
<li>Preemptive smallest number of threads first: Highest priority is given to jobs with the smallest number of unscheduled threads. An arriving job with a smaller number of threads than an executing job will preempt threads belonging to the scheduled job.</li>
</ol>
<p>10.4. What is the difference between hard and soft real-time tasks?</p>
<ul>
<li>A hard real-time task is one that must meet its deadline; otherwise it will cause unacceptabledamage or a fatal error to the system.</li>
<li>A soft real-time task has an associated deadline that is desirable but not mandatory; it still makes sense to schedule and complete the task even if it has passed its deadline.</li>
</ul>
<p>10.5. What is the difference between periodic and aperiodic real-time tasks?</p>
<ul>
<li>An aperiodic task has a deadline by which it must finish or start, or it may have a constraint on both start and finish time.</li>
<li>In the case of a periodic task, the requirement may be stated as “once per period T” or “exactly T units apart.”</li>
</ul>
<p>10.6. List and briefly define five general areas of requirements for a real-time operating system.</p>
<p>Determinism, Responsiveness, User control, Reliability, and Fail-soft operation.</p>
<p>10.7. List and briefly define four classes of real-time scheduling algorithms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Static table-driven approaches: These perform a static analysis of feasible schedules of dispatching. The result of the analysis is a schedule that determines, at run time, when a task must begin execution.</li>
<li>Static priority-driven preemptive approaches: Again, a static analysis is performed, but no schedule is drawn up. Rather, the analysis is used to assign priorities to tasks, so a traditional priority-driven preemptive scheduler can be used.</li>
<li>Dynamic planning-based approaches: Feasibility is determined at run time (dynamically) rather than offline prior to the start of execution (statically). An arriving task is accepted for execution only if it is feasible to meet its time constraints. One ofthe results of the feasibility analysis is a schedule or plan that is used to decide when to dispatch this task.</li>
<li>Dynamic best effort approaches: No feasibility analysis is performed. The system tries to meet all deadlines and aborts any started process whose deadline is missed.</li>
</ul>
<p>10.8. What items of information about a task might be useful in real-time scheduling?</p>
<ul>
<li>Ready time: Time at which task becomes ready for execution. In the case of a repetitive or periodic task, this is actually a sequence of times that is known in advance. In the case of an aperiodic task, this time may be known in advance, or the operating system may only be aware when the task is actually ready.</li>
<li>Starting deadline: Time by which a task must begin.</li>
<li>Completion deadline: Time by which a task must be completed. The typical real-time application will either have starting deadlines or completion deadlines, but not both.</li>
<li>Processing time: Time required to execute the task to completion. In some cases, this is supplied. In others, the operating system measures an exponential average (as defined in Chapter 9 ). For still other scheduling systems, this information is not used.</li>
<li>Resource requirements: Set of resources (other than the processor) required by the task while it is executing.</li>
<li>Priority: Measures relative importance of the task. Hard real-time tasks may have an “absolute” priority, with the system failing if a deadline is missed. If the system is to continue to run no matter what, then both hard and soft real-time tasks may be assigned relative priorities as a guide to the scheduler.</li>
<li>Subtask structure: A task may be decomposed into a mandatory subtask and an optional subtask. Only the mandatory subtask possesses a hard deadline.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="inputoutput-and-files">Input/Output and Files</h1>
<h2 id="io-management-and-disk-scheduling">I/O Management and Disk Scheduling</h2>
<p>11.1. List and briefly define three techniques for performing I/O.</p>
<ul>
<li>Programmed I/O: The processor issues an I/O command, on behalf of a process, to an I/O module; that process then busy waits for the operation to be completed before proceeding.</li>
<li>Interrupt-driven I/O: The processor issues an I/O command on behalf of a process. There are then two possibilities. If the I/O instruction from the process is nonblocking, then the processor continues to execute instructions from the process that issued the I/O command. If the I/O instruction is blocking, then the next instruction that the processor executes is from the OS, which will put the current process in a blocked state and schedule another process.</li>
<li>Direct memory access (DMA): A DMA module controls the exchange of data between main memory and an I/O module. The processor sends a request for the transfer of a block of data to the DMA module, and is interrupted only after the entire block has been transferred.</li>
</ul>
<p>11.2. What is the difference between logical I/O and device I/O?</p>
<ul>
<li>Logical I/O: The logical I/O module deals with the device as a logical resource and is not concerned with the details of actually controlling the device. The logical I/O module is concerned with managing general I/O functions on behalf of user processes, allowing them to deal with the device in terms of a device identifier and simple commands such as open, close, read, and write.</li>
<li>Device I/O: The requested operations and data (buffered characters, records, etc.) are converted into appropriatesequences of I/O instructions, channel commands, and controller orders. Buffering techniques may be used to improve utilization.</li>
</ul>
<p>11.3. What is the difference between block-oriented devices and stream-oriented devices? Give a few examples of each.</p>
<ul>
<li>A block-oriented device stores information in blocks that are usually of fixed size, and transfers are made one block at a time. Generally, it is possible to reference data by its block number. Disks and USB keys are examples of block- oriented devices.</li>
<li>A stream-oriented device transfers data in and out as a stream of bytes, with no block structure. Terminals, printers, communications ports, mouse and other pointing devices, and most other devices that are not secondary storage are stream-oriented.</li>
</ul>
<p>11.4. Why would you expect improved performance using a double buffer rather than a single buffer for I/O?</p>
<p>Double buffering is a programming technique that uses two buffers to speed up a computer that can overlap input output with processing. Data in one buffer are being processed while the next set of data is read into the other one.</p>
<p>11.5. What delay elements are involved in a disk read or write?</p>
<p>Seek Time. Rotational Delay. and Transfer time.</p>
<p>11.6. Briefly define the disk scheduling policies illustrated in Figure 11.7 .</p>
<p><img src="https://gsxgoldenlegendary.github.io/images/Operating_Systems/osidp11-6-0.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li><p>First-In-First-Out: The simplest form of scheduling is first-in-first-out (FIFO) scheduling, which processes items from the queue in sequential order. This strategy has the advantage of being fair, because every request is honored, and the requests are honored in the order received.</p></li>
<li>Shortest-Service-Time-First: The shortest-service-time-first (SSTF) policy is to select the disk I/O request that requires the least movement of the disk arm from its current position.</li>
<li>SCAN: With SCAN, the arm is required to move in one direction only, satisfying all outstanding requests en route, until it reaches the last track in that direction or until there are no more requests in that direction. This latter refinement is sometimes referred to as the LOOK policy. The service direction is then reversed and the scan proceeds in the opposite direction, again picking up all requests in order.</li>
<li><p>C-SCAN: The C-SCAN (circular SCAN) policy restricts scanning to one direction only. Thus, when the last track has been visited in one direction, the arm is returned to the opposite end of the disk and the scan begins again.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="file-management">File Management</h2>
<p>12.1. What is the difference between a field and a record?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Field: (1) Defined logical data that are part of a record. (2) The elementary unit of a record that may contain a data item, a data aggregate, a pointer, or a link.</p></li>
<li><p>Record: A group of data elements treated as a unit.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>12.2. What is the difference between a file and a database?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>File: A set of related records treated as a unit.</p></li>
<li><p>Database: A collection of interrelated data, often with controlled redundancy, organized according to a schema to serve one or more applications; the data are stored so they can be used by different programs without concern for the data structure or organization. A common approach is used to add new data, and to modify and retrieve existing data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>12.3. What is a file management system?</p>
<p>A set of system software that provides services to users and applications in the use of files, including file access, directory maintenance, and access control.</p>
<p>12.4. What criteria are important in choosing a file organization?</p>
<p>Short access time. Ease of update. Economy of storage. Simple maintenance. and Reliability.</p>
<p>12.5. List and briefly define five file organizations.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The pile: Data are collected in the order in which they arrive. Each record consists of one burst of data. The purpose of the pile is simply to accumulate the mass of data and save it. The purpose of the pile is simply to accumulate the mass of data and save it. Records may have different fields, or similar fields in different orders. Thus, each field should be self-describing, including a field name as well as a value. The length of each field must be implicitly indicated by delimiters, explicitly included as a subfield, or known as default for that field type.</li>
<li>The sequential file: In this type of file, a fixed format is used for records. All records are of the same length, consisting of the same number of fixed-length fields in a particular order. Because the length and position of each field are known, only the values of fields need to be stored; the field name and length for each field are attributes of the file structure.</li>
<li>The indexed sequential file: The indexed sequential file maintains the key characteristic of the sequential file: Records are organized in sequence based on a key field. Two features are added: an index to the file to support random access, and an overflow file. The index provides a lookup capability to reach quickly the vicinity of a desired record. The overflow file is similar to the log file used with a sequential file but is integrated so a record in the overflow file is located by following a pointer from its predecessor record.</li>
<li>The indexed file: The indexed sequential file retains one limitation of the sequential file: Effective processing is limited to that which is based on a single field of the file. For example, when it is necessary to search for a record on the basis of some other attribute than the key field, both forms of sequential file are inadequate. In some applications, the flexibility of efficiently searching by various attributes is desirable.</li>
<li>The direct, or hashed, file: The direct, or hashed, file exploits the capability found on disks to access directly any block of a known address. As with sequential and indexed sequential files, a key field is required in each record. However, there is no concept of sequential ordering here.</li>
</ol>
<p>12.6. Why is the average search time to find a record in a file less for an indexed sequential file than for a sequential file?</p>
<p>The index provides a lookup capability to reach quickly the vicinity of a desired record, something the sequential file does not have.</p>
<p>12.7. What are typical operations that may be performed on a directory?</p>
<ul>
<li>Search: When a user or application references a file, the directory must be searched to find the entry corresponding to that file.</li>
<li>Create file: When a new file is created, an entry must be added to the directory.</li>
<li>Delete file: When a file is deleted, an entry must be removed from the directory.</li>
<li>List directory: All or a portion of the directory may be requested. Generally, this request is made by a user and results in a listing of all files owned by that user, plus some of the attributes of each file (e.g., type, access control information, usage information).</li>
<li>Update directory: Because some file attributes are stored in the directory, a change in one of these attributes requires a change in the corresponding directory entry.</li>
</ul>
<p>12.8. What is the relationship between a pathname and a working directory?</p>
<p>The working directory enables files to be referenced relative to it, so that the entire pathname does not have to be spelled out each time you try to access a particular file.</p>
<p>12.9. What are typical access rights that may be granted or denied to a particular user for a particular file?</p>
<ul>
<li>None: The user may not even learn of the existence of the file, much less access it. To enforce this restriction, the user would not be allowed to read the user directory that includes this file.</li>
<li>Knowledge: The user can determine that the file exists and who its owner is. The user is then able to petition the owner for additional access rights.</li>
<li>Execution: The user can load and execute a program but cannot copy it. Proprietary programs are often made accessible with this restriction.</li>
<li>Reading: The user can read the file for any purpose, including copying and execution. Some systems are able to enforce a distinction between viewing and copying. In the former case, the contents of the file can be displayed to the user, but the user has no means for making a copy.</li>
<li>Appending: The user can add data to the file, often only at the end, but cannot modify or delete any of the file’s contents. This right is useful in collecting data from a number of sources.Updating: The user can modify, delete, and add to the file’s data. This normally includes writing the file initially, rewriting it completely or in part, and removing all or a portion of the data. Some systems distinguish among different degrees of updating.</li>
<li>Changing protection: The user can change the access rights granted to other users. Typically, this right is held only by the owner of the file. In some systems, the owner can extend this right to others. To prevent abuse of this mechanism, the file owner will typically be able to specify which rights can be changed by the holder of this right.</li>
<li>Deletion: The user can delete the file from the file system.</li>
</ul>
<p>12.10. List and briefly define three blocking methods.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Fixed blocking: Fixed-length records are used, and an integral number of records are stored in a block. There may be unused space at the end of each block. This is referred to as internal fragmentation.</li>
<li>Variable-length spanned blocking: Variable-length records are used and are packed into blocks with no unused space. Thus, some records must span two blocks, with the continuation indicated by a pointer to the successor block.</li>
<li>Variable-length unspanned blocking: Variable-length records are used, but spanning is not employed. There is wasted space in most blocks because of the inability to use the remainder of a block if the next record is larger than the remaining unused space.</li>
</ol>
<p>12.11. List and briefly define three file allocation methods.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First fit: Choose the first unused contiguous group of blocks of sufficient size from a free block list.</li>
<li>Best fit: Choose the smallest unused group that is of sufficient size.</li>
<li>Nearest fit: Choose the unused group of sufficient size that is closest to the previous allocation for the file to increase locality.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="embedded-systems">Embedded Systems</h1>
<h2 id="embedded-operating-systems">Embedded Operating Systems</h2>
<p>13.1. What is an embedded system?</p>
<p>The term embedded system refers to the use of electronics and software within a product that has a specific function or set of functions, as opposed to a general-purpose computer, such as a laptop or desktop system.</p>
<p>13.2. What are some typical requirements or constraints on embedded systems?</p>
<ul>
<li>There may be a variety of interfaces that enable the system to measure, manipulate, and otherwise interact with the external environment. Embedded systems often interact (sense, manipulate, and communicate) with the external world through sensors and actuators, and hence are typically reactive systems; a reactive system is in continual interaction with the environment and executes at a pace determined by that environment.</li>
<li>The human interface may be as simple as a flashing light or as complicated as real-time robotic vision. In many cases, there is no human interface.</li>
<li>The diagnostic port may be used for diagnosing the system that is being controlled—not just for diagnosing the computer.</li>
<li>Special-purpose field programmable (FPGA), application-specific (ASIC), or even nondigital hardware may be used to increase performance or reliability.</li>
<li>Software often has a fixed function and is specific to the application.</li>
<li>Efficiency is of paramount importance for embedded systems. These systems are optimized for energy, code size, execution time, weight and dimensions, and cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>13.3. What is an embedded OS?</p>
<p>A special-purpose OS designed for the embedded system environment. It is meant to handle constraints of memory space, power consumption, and real-time requirements for the embedded system environment.</p>
<p>13.4. What are some of the key characteristics of an embedded OS?</p>
<ul>
<li>Real-time operation: In many embedded systems, the correctness of a computation depends, in part, on the time at which it is delivered. Often, real-time constraints are dictated by external I/O and control stability requirements.</li>
<li>Reactive operation: Embedded software may execute in response to external events. If these events do not occur periodically or at predictable intervals, the embedded software may need to take into account worst-case conditions and set priorities for execution of routines.</li>
<li>Configurability: Because of the large variety of embedded systems, there is a large variation in the requirements, both qualitative and quantitative, for embedded OS functionality. Thus, an embedded OS intended for use on a variety of embedded systems must lend itself to flexible configuration so only the functionality needed for a specific application and hardware suite is provided.</li>
<li>I/O device flexibility: There is virtually no device that needs to be supported by all versions of the OS, and the range of I/O devices is large.</li>
<li>Streamlined protection mechanisms: Embedded systems are typically designed for a limited, well-defined functionality. Untested programs are rarely added to the software. After the software has been configured and tested, it can be assumed to be reliable. Thus, apart from security measures, embedded systems have limited protection mechanisms. For example, I/O instructions need not be privileged instructions that trap to theOS; tasks can directly perform their own I/O. Similarly, memory protection mechanisms can be minimized.</li>
<li>Direct use of interrupts: General-purpose operating systems typically do not permit any user process to use interrupts directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>13.5. Explain the relative advantages and disadvantages of an embedded OS based on an existing commercial OS compared to a purpose-built embedded OS.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Advantages: The embedded OS derived from a commercial general-purpose OS is based on a set of familiar interfaces, which facilitates portability.</p></li>
<li>Disadvantages:
<ul>
<li>Such operating systems are typically slower and less predictable than a special-purpose embedded OS.</li>
<li>The disadvantage of using a general-purpose OS is that it is not optimized for real-time and embedded applications. Thus, considerable modification may be required to achieve adequate performance. In particular, a typical OS optimizes for the average case rather than the worst case for scheduling, usually assigns resources on demand, and ignores most if not all semantic information about an application.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>13.6. What is the target application for TinyOS?</p>
<p>TinyOS was developed primarily for use with networks of small wireless sensors.</p>
<p>13.7. What are the design goals for TinyOS?</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow high concurrency: In a typical wireless sensor network application, the devices are concurrency intensive. Several different flows of data must be kept moving simultaneously. While sensor data are input in a steady stream, processed results must be transmitted in a steady stream. In addition, external controls from remote sensors or base stations must be managed.</li>
<li>Operate with limited resources: The target platform for TinyOS will have limited memory and computational resources and run on batteries or solar power. A single platform may offer only kilobytes of program memory and hundreds of bytes of RAM. The software must make efficient use of the available processor and memory resources while enabling low-power communication.</li>
<li>Adapt to hardware evolution: Most hardware is in constant evolution; applications and most system services must be portable across hardware generations. Thus, it should be possible to upgrade the hardware with little or no software change, if the functionality is the same.</li>
<li>Support a wide range of applications: Applications exhibit a wide range of requirements in terms of lifetime, communication, sensing, and so on. A modular, general-purpose embedded OS is desired so a standardized approach leads to economies of scale in developing applications and support software.</li>
<li>Support a diverse set of platforms: As with the preceding point, a general-purpose embedded OS is desirable.</li>
<li>Be robust: Once deployed, a sensor network must run unattended for months or years. Ideally, there should be redundancy both within a single system and across the network of sensors. However, both types of redundancy require additional resources. One software characteristic that can improve robustness is to use highly modular, standardized software components.</li>
</ul>
<p>13.8. What is a TinyOS component?</p>
<p>An embedded software system built using TinyOS consists of a set of small modules, called components, each of which performs a simple task or set of tasks and which interface with each other and with hardware in limited and well-defined ways.</p>
<p>13.9. What software comprises the TinyOS operating system?</p>
<p>Examples of such standardized components include single-hop networking, ad hoc routing, power management, timers, and nonvolatile storage control.</p>
<p>13.10. What is the default scheduling discipline for TinyOS?</p>
<p>A simple FIFO (first-in-first-out) queue.</p>
<h2 id="virtual-machines">Virtual Machines</h2>
<p>14.1. Briefly describe Type 1 and Type 2 virtualization.</p>
<ul>
<li>A type 1 hypervisor (see Figure14.2a ) is loaded as a software layer directly onto a physical server, much like an OS is loaded. The type 1 hypervisor can directly control the physical resources of the host. Once it is installed and configured, the server is then capable of supporting virtual machines as guests. In mature environments, where virtualization hosts are clustered together for increased availability and load balancing, a hypervisor can be staged on a new host. Then, that new host is joined to an existing cluster, and VMs can be moved to the new host without any interruption of service.</li>
<li>A type 2 hypervisor exploits the resources and functions of a host OS and runs as a software module on top of the OS (see Figure 14.2b ). It relies on the OS to handle all of the hardware interactions on the hypervisor’s behalf.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://gsxgoldenlegendary.github.io/images/Operating_Systems/osidp11-7-2.png" /></p>
<p>14.2. Briefly describe container virtualization.</p>
<p>In this approach, software, known as a virtualization container, runs on top of the host OS kernel and provides an isolated execution environment for applications. Unlike hypervisor-based VMs, containers do not aim to emulate physical servers. Instead, all containerized applications on a host share a common OS kernel.</p>
<p>14.3. Explain the concept of ballooning.</p>
<p>The hypervisor activates a balloon driver that (virtually) inflates and presses the guest operating system to flush pages to disk. Once the pages are cleared, the balloon driver deflates and the hypervisor can use the physical memory for other VMs. This process happens during times of memory contention.</p>
<p>14.4. Give a brief description of Java VM.</p>
<p>The JVM is described as being an abstract computing machine, consisting of an instruction set, a pc (program counter) register, a stack to hold variables and results, a heap for runtime data and garbage collection, and a method area for code and constants.</p>
<h2 id="operating-system-security">Operating System Security</h2>
<p>15.1. What are typical access rights that may be granted or denied to a particular user for a particular file?</p>
<ul>
<li>None: The user may not even learn of the existence of the file, much less access it. To enforce this restriction, the user would not be allowed to read the user directory that includes this file.</li>
<li>Knowledge: The user can determine that the file exists and who its owner is. The user is then able to petition the owner for additional access rights.</li>
<li>Execution: The user can load and execute a program but cannot copy it. Proprietary programs are often made accessible with this restriction.</li>
<li>Reading: The user can read the file for any purpose, including copying and execution. Some systems are able to enforce a distinction between viewing and copying. In the former case, the contents of the file can be displayed to the user, but the user has no means for making a copy.</li>
<li>Appending: The user can add data to the file, often only at the end, but cannot modify or delete any of the file’s contents. This right is useful in collecting data from a number of sources.Updating: The user can modify, delete, and add to the file’s data. This normally includes writing the file initially, rewriting it completely or in part, and removing all or a portion of the data. Some systems distinguish among different degrees of updating.</li>
<li>Changing protection: The user can change the access rights granted to other users. Typically, this right is held only by the owner of the file. In some systems, the owner can extend this right to others. To prevent abuse of this mechanism, the file owner will typically be able to specify which rights can be changed by the holder of this right.</li>
<li>Deletion: The user can delete the file from the file system.</li>
</ul>
<p>15.2. List and briefly define three classes of intruders.</p>
<ul>
<li>Masquerader: An individual who is not authorized to use the computer and who penetrates a system’s access controls to exploit a legitimate user’s account.</li>
<li>Misfeasor: A legitimate user who accesses data, programs, or resources for which such access is not authorized, or who is authorized for such access but misuses his or her privileges.</li>
<li>Clandestine user: An individual who seizes supervisory control of the system and uses this control to evade auditing and access controls or to suppress audit collection.</li>
</ul>
<p>15.3. In general terms, what are four means of authenticating a user’s identity?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Something the individual knows: Examples include a password, a personal identification number (PIN), or answers to a prearranged set of questions.</li>
<li>Something the individual possesses: Examples include electronic keycards, smart cards, and physical keys. This type of authenticator is referred to as a token.</li>
<li>Something the individual is (static biometrics): Examples include recognition by fingerprint, retina, and face.</li>
<li>Something the individual does (dynamic biometrics): Examples include recognition by voice pattern, handwriting characteristics, and typing rhythm.</li>
</ol>
<p>15.4. Briefly describe the difference between DAC and RBAC.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Discretionary access control (DAC): Controls access based on the identity of the requestor and on access rules (authorizations) stating what requestors are (or are not) allowed to do. This policy is termed discretionary because an entity might have access rights that permit the entity, by its own volition, to enable another entity to access some resource.</p></li>
<li><p>Role-based access control (RBAC): Controls access based on the roles that users have within the system, and on rules stating what accesses are allowed to users in given roles</p></li>
</ul>
<p>15.5. What types of programming languages are vulnerable to buffer overflows?</p>
<p>Languages which are not strongly-typed are vulnerable to buffer overflows.</p>
<p>15.6. What are the two broad categories of defenses against buffer overflows?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Compile-time defenses, which aim to harden programs to resist attacks</li>
<li>Runtime defenses, which aim to detect and abort attacks in executing programs programs</li>
</ol>
<p>15.7. List and briefly describe some of the defenses against buffer overflows that can be used when compiling new programs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Choice of Programming Language: One possibility is to write the program using a modern high-level programming language, one that has a strong notion of variable type and what constitutes permissible operations on them.</li>
<li>Safe Coding Techniques: In order to harden these systems, the programmer needs to inspect the code and rewrite any unsafe coding constructs in a safe manner.</li>
<li>Language Extensions and Use of Safe Libraries: Given the problems that can occur in C with unsafe array and pointer references, there have been a number of proposals to augment compilers to automatically insert range checks on such references.</li>
<li>Stack Protection Mechanisms: An effective method for protecting programs against classic stack overflow attacks is to instrument the function entry and exit code to set up and then check its stack frame for any evidence of corruption. If any modification is found, the program is aborted rather than allowing the attack to proceed.</li>
</ul>
<p>15.8. List and briefly describe some of the defenses against buffer overflows that can be implemented when running existing, vulnerable programs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Executable Address Space Protection: Many of the buffer overflow attacks involve copying machine code into the targeted buffer then transferring execution to it. A possible defense is to block the execution of code on the stack, on the assumption that executable code should only be found elsewhere in the processes address space.</li>
<li>Address Space Randomization: Another runtime technique that can be used to thwart attacks involves manipulation of the location of key data structures in the address space of a process.</li>
<li>Guard Pages: A final runtime technique that can be used places guard pages between critical regions of memory in a processes address space. These gaps, or guard pages, are flagged in the MMU as illegal addresses, and any attempt to access them results in the process being aborted.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cloud-and-iot-operating-systems">Cloud and IOT Operating Systems</h2>
<p>16.1 Define cloud computing.</p>
<p>A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model promotes availability and is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models.</p>
<p>16.2 List and briefly define three cloud service models.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Software as a Service: SaaS provides service to customers in the form of software, specifically application software, running on and accessible in the cloud.</li>
<li>Platform as a Service: A PaaS cloud provides service to customers in the form of a platform on which the customer’s applications can run.</li>
<li>Infrastructure as a Service: With IaaS, the customer has access to the resources of the underlying cloud infrastructure. The cloud service user does not manage or control the resources of the underlying cloud infrastructure, but has control over operating systems, deployed applications, and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).</li>
</ol>
<p>16.3 What is the cloud computing reference architecture?</p>
<p>The NIST cloud computing reference architecture focuses on the requirements of “what” cloud services provide, not a “how to” design solution and implementation. The reference architecture is intended to facilitate the understanding of the operational intricacies in cloud computing. It does not represent the system architecture of a specific cloud computing system; instead it is a tool for describing, discussing, and developing a system-specific architecture using a common framework of reference.</p>
<p>16.4 List and briefly define the key components of a cloud operating system.</p>
<p>Database and Object Storage, Management and Orchestration, Virtual computing, Virtual storage, and Virtual network.</p>
<p>16.5 What is the relationship between a cloud OS and IaaS?</p>
<p>A cloud OS must manage and provides CSCs with access to an IaaS environment.</p>
<p>16.6 What is OpenStack?</p>
<p>OpenStack is an open-source software project of the OpenStack Foundation that aims to produce an open-source cloud operating system.</p>
<p>16.7 Define the Internet of Things.</p>
<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is a term that refers to the expanding interconnection of smart devices, ranging from appliances to tiny sensors. A dominant theme is the embedding of short-range mobile transceivers into a wide array of gadgets and everyday items, enabling new forms of communication between people and things, and between things themselves.</p>
<p>16.8 List and briefly define the principal components of an IoT-enabled thing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sensor: A sensor measures some parameter of a physical, chemical, or biological entity and delivers an electronic signal proportional to the observed characteristic, either in the form of an analog voltage level or a digital signal. In both cases, the sensor output is typically input to a microcontroller or other management element.</li>
<li>Actuator: An actuator receives an electronic signal from a controller and responds by interacting with its environment to produce an effect on some parameter of a physical, chemical, or biological entity.</li>
<li>Microcontroller: The “smart” in a smart device is provided by a deeply embedded microcontroller. Transceiver: A transceiver contains the electronics needed to transmit and receive data. Most IoT devices contain a wireless transceiver, capable of communication using Wi-Fi, ZigBee, or some other wireless scheme.</li>
<li>Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID): (RFID) technology, which uses radio waves to identify items, is increasingly becoming an enabling technology for IoT. The main elements of an RFID system are tags and readers. RFID tags are small programmable devices used for object, animal, and humantracking. They come in a variety of shapes, sizes, functionalities, and costs. RFID readers acquire and sometimes rewrite information stored on RFID tags that come within operating range (a few inches up to several feet). Readers are usually connected to a computer system that records and formats the acquired information for further uses.</li>
</ul>
<p>16.9 What requirements should an IoT OS satisfy?</p>
<p>Small memory footprint, Support for heterogeneous hardware, Network connectivity, Energy efficiency, Real-time capabilities, and Security.</p>
<p>16.10 What is RIOT?</p>
<p>An open-source OS designed specifically for constrained IoT devices.</p>
